ðŸ‘‹ Hello! My name is Peter Wachira, a passionate software developer and a Christian. I have always had great enthusiasm for creating quality software applications and building systems that impact the lives of people.  I have a strong background in tech. Not long ago, I graduated from moringa school based in Nairobi, Kenya. I spent 8 months getting acquainted with the process of building real software applications. Currently, I have been working as a software developer for the last 18 months using android and web development languages by leveraging software-development Life, Cycle methodologies to drive positive personal/team outcomes to increase velocity and on-time delivery of projects. These experiences have significantly contributed to how I approach and solve technical problems. When not immersed in code, plus some jazzy music, you'll find me listening to a podcast, or taking nature walks. Some of the exciting projects I've worked on are https://peter-wachira.github.io/droid/
